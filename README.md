Your job is to build a trip-planner website using both the `alert` and `prompt` functions in JavaScript. You will be coding your solution in `js/planner.js`. You'll want to have `index.html` open in the browser to test your work.

You'll be using the `prompt` function to take in input from your user, and `alert` to relay information back to the user. 

You can store the input from the user by using a variable:

```js
var name = prompt('Please enter your name:');
```

In the example above, we've declared the variable `name` and set it equal to `prompt('Please enter your name:')`. In this line of code, the `name` variable will store whatever name the user enters in the text box that appears in the browser.

Now that we have the data from the user stored in the variable `name`, we can use that variable in our code to manipulate the data.


## Get To Work

+ **Step 1:** Your job is to take in the follow information from the user:
```
name
age
trip_destination
number_of_travelers
type_of_trip (relaxing, adventure, etc)
```
+ **Step 2:** Once you have all the information you need, your job is to print out a sentence describing the user's vacation wishes and a promise to find them the best possible trip.

+ **BONUS:** Once the user enters what find of trip they want, see if you can figure out how to make suggestions based on what type of trip (ie: suggest a beach vacation for a relaxing trip, or hiking Machu Pichu for an adventure trip).
